# Moving Library Architecture

The Moving Library is the code–pattern engine for the MindsEye OS.

It performs:

1. Code → Binary → Pattern analysis  
2. Entropy + hash signature generation  
3. Time-labeling (LAW-T)  
4. Network intent (LAW-N)  
5. Pattern storage and retrieval  
6. Variant generation (code mutation)  

This forms the foundation for evolving agent code.
